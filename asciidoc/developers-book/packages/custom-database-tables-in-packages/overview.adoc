While most packages don't require it, if a developer needs custom database tables for any reason, these can easily be created during a package installation.

This can be done in one of three ways.

1.  Provide the schema of the database in the http://www.concrete5.org/documentation/how-tos/developers/creating-and-working-with-db-xml-files/[AXMLS format]. This format has been available in Concrete5 since the very beginning.
2.  Provide the schema of the database in the Doctrine XML format. This is a new format, dependent on the new Doctrine Database Access Layer employed in Concrete5 version 7 and above. *This approach requires Concrete5 version 5.7.5 or above*
3.  Use http://doctrine-orm.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html[PHP Entity Classes and the Doctrine 2 ORM Library] that Concrete5 includes. This requires Concrete5 5.7.4 or above.
